OOP-> Object Oriented Programming

Featuers of OOP
1)object : Any entity which has own state and behaviour that is called an object
ex: pen,paper,chair etc.

2)class : collection of objects
ex: human body

			or 

A class is a template to create objects having similar properties and behavior, 
or in other words, we can say that a class is a blueprint for objects

3)abstraction : hiding internal details and showing functionalities
ex: login page

4)encapsulation : wrapping up of data or binding of data
ex: capsule
				or
Encapsulation is a programming concept that bundles data (attributes) 
and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit, like a class

5)inheritance : When one object acquire all the properties and behaviour of
parent class
ex: father-son

parent - child
super - sub
base - derived


6)polymorphism : Many ways to perform anything
ex:
1)Overloading
2)Overriding

Access Modifier/Specifier:
public
private
protected
